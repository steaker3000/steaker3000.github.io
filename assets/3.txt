A mall grab is a way of holding your skateboard with the grip tape facing your pants, and gripping it by the trucks. It is called mall grabbing because the skate community has decided that people that hold their board like that are probably posers and carry it more than they ride it, so they carry it around a “mall” as an accessory, hence the “mall” grab.
